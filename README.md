# CANedge Grafana Backend - Visualize CAN/LIN Data in Dashboards

This project enables easy dashboard visualization of log files from the [CANedge](https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/can-bus-hardware-products) CAN/LIN data logger. 

Specifically, a light-weight backend app loads, DBC decodes and parses MDF log files from local disk or an S3 server. This is done 'on demand' in response to query requests sent from a [Grafana dashboard](https://grafana.com/) frontend by end users. 

**This project is currently in BETA - major changes will be made.**

## Backend vs. Writer
We provide two options for integrating your CANedge data with Grafana dashboards:

The [CANedge Grafana Backend](https://github.com/CSS-Electronics/canedge-grafana-backend) app only processes data 'when needed' by an end user - and requires no database. It is ideal when you have large amounts of data - as you only process the data you need to visualize. 

The [CANedge InfluxDB Writer](https://github.com/CSS-Electronics/canedge-influxdb-writer) processes data in advance (e.g. periodically or on-file-upload) and writes it to a database. It is ideal if dashboard loading speed is critical - but with the downside that data is processed & stored even if it is not used.

For details incl. 'pros & cons', see our [intro to telematics dashboards](https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/telematics-dashboard-open-source).

## Installation
In this section we detail how to deploy the app on a PC or an AWS EC2 instance. 

Note: We recommend to test the local deployment with our sample data as the first step.

----

### 1: Deploy the integration locally on your PC

A local PC deployment is recommended if you wish to load data from an SD, local disk or MinIO S3.

- [Watch the step-by-step video](https://canlogger1000.csselectronics.com/img/canedge-grafana-backend-local_v3.mp4)

#### Deploy the backend app locally
- Install Python 3.7 for Windows ([32 bit](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.9/python-3.7.9.exe)/[64 bit](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.9/python-3.7.9-amd64.exe)) or [Linux](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/) (_enable 'Add to PATH'_)
- Download this project as a zip via the green button and unzip it 
- Open the folder with the `requirements.txt` file and enter below in your [command prompt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgSSJQolR0E&t=47s):

##### Windows 
```
python -m venv env & env\Scripts\activate & pip install -r requirements.txt
python canedge_datasource_cli.py "file:///%cd%/LOG" --port 8080 --limit 100
```

##### Linux 
```
python -m venv env && source env/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
python canedge_datasource_cli.py file:///$PWD/LOG --port 8080 --limit 100
```

#### Set up Grafana locally
- [Install Grafana locally](https://grafana.com/grafana/download?platform=windows) and enter `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to open Grafana
- In `Configuration/Plugins` install `SimpleJson` and `TrackMap`
- In `Configuration/DataSources/Add datasource` select `SimpleJson`, set it as `default` with `Timeout = 1000`
- Enter the URL `http://localhost:8080/`, hit `Save & test` and verify that it works
- In `Dashboards/Browse` click `Import` and load the `dashboard-template-sample-data.json` from this repo 

You should now see the sample data visualized in Grafana. 

**Next:** If you aim to work with CANedge2 data from AWS S3, go to step 2 - otherwise go to step 3.

----

### 2: Deploy the integration on AWS EC2 & Grafana Cloud
An [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance is recommended if you wish to load data from your AWS S3 bucket.

- [Watch the step-by-step video](https://canlogger1000.csselectronics.com/img/canedge-grafana-backend-aws-ec2-cloud_v3.mp4)

#### Deploy the backend app on AWS EC2 

- Login to AWS and verify that you are in the same region as your S3 bucket (upper right corner)
- Search for `EC2/Instances` and click `Launch instances`
- Select `Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type`, `t3.small` and proceed
- In `Step 6`, click `Add Rule/Custom TCP Rule` and set `Port Range` to `8080`
- Launch the instance, then create & store your credentials (we will not use them for now) 
- Wait ~5 min, click on your instance and note your IP (the `Public IPv4 address`)
- Click `Connect/Connect` to enter the GUI console, then enter the following:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv tmux python-is-python3 -y
git clone https://github.com/CSS-Electronics/canedge-grafana-backend.git && cd canedge-grafana-backend
python -m venv env && source env/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
tmux
python canedge_datasource_cli.py file:///$PWD/LOG --port 8080 --limit 100
```

#### Set up Grafana Cloud
- [Set up](https://grafana.com/auth/sign-up/create-user) a free Grafana Cloud account and log in
- In `Configuration/Plugins` install `SimpleJson` and `TrackMap` (log out and in again)
- In `Configuration/DataSources/Add datasource` select `SimpleJson`, set it as `default` with `Timeout = 1000`
- Replace your datasource URL with the `http://[IP]:[port]` endpoint and click `Save & test` 
- In `Dashboards/Browse` click `Import` and load the `dashboard-template-sample-data.json` from this repo 

You should now see the sample data visualized in your imported dashboard. In the AWS EC2 console you can press `ctrl + B` then `D` to de-attach from the session, allowing it to run even when you close the GUI console.

**Next:** See step 3 on loading your AWS S3 data and step 5 on deploying the app as a service for production.


-----

### 3: Load your own data & DBC files 
Below we outline how to load your own data & DBC files. 

Note: To activate your virtual environment use `env\Scripts\activate` (Linux: `source env/bin/activate`)

#### Load from local disk 
- Replace the sample `LOG/` folder with your own `LOG/` folder (or add an absolute path)
- Verify that your data is structured as on the CANedge SD card i.e. `[device_id]/[session]/[split].MF4`
- Add your DBC file(s) to the root of the folder
- Verify that your venv is active and start the app  

#### Load from S3
- Add your DBC file(s) to the root of your S3 bucket 
- Verify that your venv is active and start the app with below syntax

```
python canedge_datasource_cli.py endpoint --port 8080 --limit 100 --s3_ak access_key --s3_sk secret_key --s3_bucket bucket
```

- AWS S3 endpoint example: `https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com`
- Google S3 endpoint example: `https://storage.googleapis.com`
- MinIO S3 endpoint example: `http://192.168.192.1:9000`

#### Import simplified dashboard template 
- To get started, import the `dashboard-template-simple.json` to visualize your own data
- After this, you can optionally start customizing your panels as explained in step 4

#### Regarding DBC files 
You can load as many DBC files as you want without reducing performance, as long as your queries only use one at a time (as is e.g. the case when using the simple dashboard template). However, if your queries need to use multiple DBC files, you may consider 'combining' your DBC files for optimal performance.

#### Regarding compression
We recommend enabling the CANedge compression as the `MFC` files are 50%+ smaller and thus faster to load.

----

### 4: Customize your Grafana dashboard

The `dashboard-template-sample-data.json` can be used to identify how to make queries, incl. below examples:

```
# create a fully customized query that depends on what the user selects in the dropdown 
{"device":"${DEVICE}","itf":"${ITF}","chn":"${CHN}","db":"${DB}","signal":"${SIGNAL}"}

# create a query for a panel that locks a signal, but keeps the device selectable
{"device":"${DEVICE}","itf":"CAN","chn":"CH2","db":"canmod-gps","signal":"Speed"}

# create a query for parsing multiple signals, e.g. for a TrackMap plot
{"device":"${DEVICE}","itf":"CAN","chn":"CH2","db":"canmod-gps","signal":"(Latitude|Longitude)"}
```

#### Bundle queries for multiple panels 
When displaying multiple panels in your dashboard, it is critical to setup all queries in a single panel (as in our sample data template). All other panels can then be set up to refer to the original panel by setting the datasource as `-- Dashboard --`. For both the 'query panel' and 'referring panels' you can then use the `Transform` tab to `Filter data by query`. This allows you to specify which query should be displayed in which panel. The end result is that only 1 query is sent to the backend - which means that your CANedge log files are only processed once per update.

#### Set up Grafana Variables 
Grafana [Variables](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/variables/) allow users to dynamically control what is displayed in certain panels via dropdowns. If you load the dashboard templates, you can find a range of supported Variable queries in `Settings/Variables`.

For example, the `DEVICE` Variable is a `Query` type using SimpleJson as datasource and the query `{"search":"device_name"}`. This will list all CANedge device serial numbers in the source folder and add the 'meta' field from the last log file header of each device. 

Replacing `device_name` for `device` displays only the device ID. If you want to add a hardcoded list of device names, you can do so by using the type `Custom` and in the values field add `name_1 : id_1, name2 : id_2` where the names reflect the names to be displayed in the dropdown, while the ids reflect the serial numbers of the CANedge devices. If you have a large number of CANedge devices, using either the `device` query or the custom approach can increase performance. 

<img src="https://canlogger1000.csselectronics.com/img/Grafana-Variables.jpg" width="679.455" height="226.477">


#### Set up Grafana Annotations 

Annotations can be used to display when a new log file 'session' or 'split' occurs, as well as display the log file name. This makes it easy to identify the log files behind a specific time period - and then finding these via [CANcloud](https://canlogger.csselectronics.com/canedge-getting-started/transfer-data/server-tools/cancloud-intro/) or [TntDrive](https://canlogger.csselectronics.com/canedge-getting-started/transfer-data/server-tools/other-s3-tools/) for further processing.


#### Regarding performance & stability
If a request is initiated while the backend is in-progress, it'll cause a `501` error and the in-progress query will be cancelled. This helps avoid generating long queues of requests when users e.g. zoom out quickly. 

Further, the backend supports the `--limit` input, speciying how much log file data can be requested in one query - by default set at 100 MB. If a query exceeds this, it'll get aborted when the limit is reached. This helps avoid users initiating extreme queries of e.g. several GB. 

Note also that loading speed increases when displaying long time periods (as the data for the period is processed in real-time).

----

### 5: Move to a production setup

##### Managing your EC2 tmux session

Below commands are useful in managing your `tmux` session while you're still testing your deployment.

- `tmux`: Start a session
- `tmux ls`: List sessions 
- `tmux attach`: Re-attach to session
- `tmux kill-session`: Stop session

#### Deploy your app as an EC2 service for production

The above setup is suitable for development & testing. Once you're ready to deploy for production, you may prefer to set up a service. This ensures that your app automatically restarts after an instance reboot or a crash. To set it up as a service, follow the below steps:

- Ensure you've followed the previous EC2 steps incl. the virtual environment
- Update the `ExecStart` line in the `canedge_grafana_backend.service` 'unit file' with your S3 details
- Upload the modified file to get a public URL
- In your EC2 instance, use below commands to deploy the file

```
sudo wget -N [your_file_url]
sudo cp canedge_grafana_backend.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start canedge_grafana_backend
sudo systemctl enable canedge_grafana_backend
sudo journalctl -f -u canedge_grafana_backend
```

The service should now be deployed, which you can verify via the console output. If you need to make updates to your unit file, simply repeat the above. You can stop the service via `sudo systemctl stop [service]`.

#### Regarding EC2 costs
You can find details on AWS EC2 pricing [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/). A `t3.small` instance typically costs ~0.02$/hour (~15-20$/month). We recommend that you monitor usage during your tests early on to ensure that no unexpected cost developments occur. Note also that you do not pay for the data transfer from S3 into EC2 if deployed within the same region. 

#### Regarding public EC2 IP 
Note that rebooting your EC2 instance will imply that your endpoint IP is changed - and thus you'll need to update your datasource. There are methods to set a fixed IP, though not in scope of this README. 

#### Regarding EC2 memory 
The backend will use RAM both for storing dataframes when processing log files, as well as for caching. The required RAM depends on your log file size and DBC - we recommend at least 2 GB of RAM for most use cases (which e.g. the `t3.small` has). On AWS EC2, the default behavior will be to 'kill' the process if RAM usage exceeds available memory. As an alternative to this behavior, you can consider using a (swap file](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Swap#Swap_file).


#### Port forwarding a local deployment

If you want to access the data remotely, you can set up port forwarding. Below we outline how to port forward the backend app for use as a datasource in Grafana Cloud - but you could of course also directly port forward your local Grafana dashboard directly via port `3000`. 

- Set up [port forwarding](https://portforward.com/) on your WiFi router for port `8080`
- Run the app again (you may need to allow access via your firewall)
- Find your [public IP](https://www.whatismyip.com/) to get your endpoint as: `http://[IP]:[port]` (e.g. `http://5.105.117.49:8080/`)
- In Grafana, add your new endpoint URL and click `Save & test`
